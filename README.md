## Introduction to Scala

### What is Scala?
Scala is a modern, general-purpose programming language designed to communicate common programming constructs in a concise, elegant and efficient manner. Scala is a blend of the two words, "scalable language," which imply the language is designed to grow per the demand of its users.

### History
Scala was created by German Scientist, Martin Odersky, who started its designs in 2001. It was influenced by many languages such as Erlang, Haskell, Standard ML, and most notably, Java. Its first version (1.0) was released in 2003, but made its way to the Java platform in 2004. Its second version (2.0) was released in 2006. The current most stable version, 2.12.8, was released on December 4, 2018. The langugage is approximately 15 years old, so its longevity does not give it as much credibility as the likes of C, C++, Python, and Java, but it has been maintained and updated frequently since its initial release, and it is getting very popular among programmers.

### Interesting features
- It is purely object-oriented
- It is a functional programming language
- It is statically typed
- It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

## About the syntax
Scala shares very similar syntax to Java, so if you have a strong understanding and working knowledge of Java, it will be easy and fast for you to learn Scala.

Some basic constructs include: 
- expressions
- blocks 
- classes
- objects
- functions
- methods
- traits
- closures.

*Hello World example*

```scala
object HelloWorld {
   // This is my first java program.  
   // This will print 'Hello World' as the output
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println("Hello, world!")
   }
}
```
